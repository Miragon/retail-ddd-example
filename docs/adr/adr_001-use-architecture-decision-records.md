# ADR 0001: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ðŸ“Œ Status

Accepted

## ðŸ§­ Context

In any software project, architectural and technical decisions are made continuously.
Over time, the reasons behind these decisions can become unclear or lost entirely.
To improve transparency, maintainability, and knowledge sharing,
it's important to document these decisions in a lightweight and consistent way.

## âœ… Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
to document significant decisions made throughout the lifecycle of this project.
Each ADR will be a Markdown file stored in a dedicated `docs/adr/` directory
and follow a consistent format.

In addition to documenting decisions, we aim to **measure** and **enforce** them wherever feasible.
One practical approach to this is using tools like [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/)
to write executable architecture rules that validate our design choices automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Consequences

- All relevant architectural and technical decisions will be recorded as ADRs.
- Decisions will be more traceable, transparent, and maintainable.
- We will strive to support decisions with measurable or enforceable criteria.
- New team members can quickly understand the reasoning behind decisions.
- We establish a historical record of changes in direction.
- Minor or obvious decisions may not need a full ADR, keeping the process lean.
